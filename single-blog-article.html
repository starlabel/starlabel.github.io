            <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>
            <p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. &quot;What&#x27;s happened to me? &quot; he thought. It wasn&#x27;t a dream.</p>
            <p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.<br></p>
            <blockquote>These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.

            <p>These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when ouHe must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn&#x27;t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. &quot;Oh, God&quot;, he thought, &quot;what a strenuous career it is that I&#x27;ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out.</p>

            <p>If I didn&#x27;t have my parents to think about I&#x27;d have given in my notice a long time ago, I&#x27;d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He&#x27;d fall right off his desk!</p>

Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.</p>

            <p>And it&#x27;s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there&#x27;s still some hope; once I&#x27;ve got the money together to pay off my parents&#x27; debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that&#x27;s definitely what I&#x27;ll do.</p>
            <p>That&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll make the big change. First of all though, I&#x27;ve got to get up, my train leaves at five. &quot; And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. &quot;God in Heaven! &quot; he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o&#x27;clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?</p>
